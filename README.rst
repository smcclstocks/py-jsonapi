==========

.. note::

    **This library is under active development.**
    **If you have any suggestions or found bugs, please create a new issue.**


This library is a toolkit for building a http://jsonapi.org/ compliant API. It
has built in support for many web frameworks and database drivers:

*   flask
*   tornado
*   sqlalchemy
*   mongoengine
*   motorengine

Furthermore, it can be extended to work with **all web frameworks and database
engines**.

But that's not all: We support **blocking and asynchronous** code.
